
The File Aliases module allows you to use token customizable aliases for your
uploaded files, giving you the ability to keep your file system organized as per
usual while providing clean looking paths (i.e., no more '/sites/default/files/').

File Aliases was written and is maintained by Stuart Clark (deciphered).
