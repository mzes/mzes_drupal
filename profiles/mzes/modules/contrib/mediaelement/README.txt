Media Element
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Provides HTML5 video and audio elements using Mediaelement.js for HTML4 browsers.

Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Download MediaElement from http://mediaelementjs.com/
2. Unzip into a libraries directory as supported by the libraries module with
   the name mediaelement (e.g., /sites/all/libraries/mediaelement).
3. Install the libraries and mediaelement modules.

Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set a file field or link field to use video (or audio) as its display formatter.
Or use the media module (http://drupal.org/project/media) if you want to have your
file field display images and video.

API
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This module supplies the MediaElement library as a Drupal library and has some
helper functions if you want to use it independently of fields. To add the
library into a page use the command:

drupal_add_library('mediaelement', 'mediaelement');

If you want to Use the helper scripts include the script mediaelement.js included
with the module. You can do it using a command like:

drupal_add_js(drupal_get_path('module', 'mediaelement') . '/mediaelement.js');

Then you need to add settings for the script. They are a selector for jQuery and
settings. For example:

$settings = array('mediaelement' => array(
  '.class-name' => array(
    'controls' => TRUE,
    'opts' => array(), // This is the mediaelement scripts options.
  );
));
drupal_add_js($settings, 'setting');
